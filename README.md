Basic Maze Game

Resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm.

Maze generation algorithm is implemented using upper link and iterative implementation method used. Basic rules in this game are listed below:

1. In this maze, 1s is considered as walls and 0s as roads. The user enters from the upper input and exit from the lower exit. The starting point of the labyrinth is at the (0,0) point and the exit point can be any tip of labyrinth.
2. Labyrinth size is requested from the user and it is be at least 10x10 and at most 100x100.
3. The player must make the moves.
4. The program creates different labyrinths each time.
5. There may be a dead end in the labyrinth. However, there must be at least one exit in the maze (not necessarily a corner).
6. There is n monsters at different locations in the maze. When the monsters are reached, the game should start again.
7. There is m number of gold coins in the labyrinth and the collected gold is counted. At the end of the game, the number of gold collected is shown to the user.
8. All moves made must be saved in a file.
9. As a result, the output path is listed as below and saved in a text file.
